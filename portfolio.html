    <h1>First words </h1>
    <p class="breadtext">During this semester I have come to realize that I have been not been active enough when it came to coding. <br> Since I had already quite some experience working in Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, Premiere Pro and After Effects I ended up mainly focusing my energy and time in these activites during this course, rather than challenging and developing my skills within other topics too, hence I have so few projects related with code that have  submitted myself.</p>
     <p class="breadtext"> Moving closer to the final weeks of studies I aknowledged my limited knowledge and it was time to create this website, I have submerged myself into hours of bingewatching tutorials and playing around with html and css in order to give it my best.</p>
     <p class="breadtext"> I'm still learning more about css and javascript posibilites and I hope you will enjoy what I have prepared for you so far :)</p>
